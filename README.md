# Proxy Pro
The Proxy Pro pugin is to help get more proxy servers out there and available to the public.

## Proxy Search
Searching for proxies comes in two forms. You can either specify an IP address and the searcher will run to the end of the addresses. So for example if you specify the IP address '67.67.67.6', the search will search from that IP to '67.67.67.255' looking for proxy servers.

The second way to search is to simple hit the random search button which will tell the proxy searcher to choose a random IP range and search for proxy servers.
